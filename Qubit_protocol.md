Protocol: Measuring the DNA Content using a QubitTM 3.0 fluorometer and the Qubit™ dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Modified Protocol)

1.	Label the 500 µl Qubit assay tubes 

2.	Prepare Standards 1 & 2.
	For Standard 1, add 10 µl of Standard 1 stock solution to 190 µl of Qubit Working Solution. For Standard 2, 	add 10 µl of Standard 2 stock solution to 190 µl of Qubit Working Solution.

3.	Dilute 1 µl of sample DNA in 199 µl of Qubit Working Solution.

4.	Mix by vortexing for 5 seconds without creating bubbles

5.	Incubate for 2 minutes at room temperature.

6.	Select the dsDNA High sensitivity assay type on the home screen.

7.	Calibrate by reading Standards 1 and 2 successively.

8.	Read the sample and set sample volume to 1 µl.
