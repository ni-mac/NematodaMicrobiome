Protocol: Clean-Up of the Pool using the Cytiva Sera-Mag Select Cleaning Kit with Left Side Size Selection (Modified Protocol)

1.	Thaw beads at room temperature. Then, Resuspend the beads by vortexing for 3 minutes (min).

2.	To 420 µl of pool, add 294 µl (0.7x amount of pool). Then, mix by vortexing and for 60 seconds (s), briefly spin down and incubate at room temperature (RT) for 10 min.

3.	Place the tube on a magnetic rack for 5 min until the beads have fully settled.

4.	Discard the supernatant.

5.	Without disturbing the pellet and while leaving the tube on the magnet, wash with 1 ml of 85 % ethanol. Then, discard the supernatant

6.	Repeat Step 5. Make sure to remove as much ethanol as possible after the second wash.

7.	Dry the beads at RT for 8 min.

8.	Add 100 µl of nuclease-free water, mix by vortexing for 60 s and spin down. 

9.	Incubate for 10 min at RT to elute the DNA.

10.	Place the tube on a magnetic rack for 4 min until the beads have fully settled. 

11.	Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
