Protocol: DNA Extraction for Microbiome Analysis using the ZymoBIOMICSTM DNA Microprep Kit (Modified Protocol)

1.	Add nematodes to DNA/RNA ShieldTM Lysis Tubes.

2.	Add 50 µl Proteinase K and incubate overnight at 55°C.

3.	Place samples in a tube holder on a Vortex-Genie® 2 at 2,000 rpm for 40 minutes.

4.	Centrifuge the DNA/RNA ShieldTM Lysis Tubes in an Eppendorf Centrifuge 5424 at 10,000 x g for 1 minute. 

5.	Add 400 µl of supernatant to a new 2 ml microcentrifuge tube. 

6.	Add 1,200 µl of ZymoBIOMICSTM DNA Binding Buffer to the filtrate in the microcentrifuge tube from Step 5. 	Mix well. 

7.	Transfer 800 µl of the mixture from Step 6 to a Zymo-SpinTM IC Column in a Collection Tube. Centrifuge at 	10,000 x g for 1 minute. 

8.	Discard the flow-through from the Collection Tube and repeat Step 7.

9.	Add 400 µl ZymoBIOMICSTM DNA Wash Buffer 1 to the Zymo-SpinTM IC Column in a new Collection Tube. 	Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through. 

10.	Add 700 µl ZymoBIOMICSTM DNA Wash Buffer 2 to the Zymo-SpinTM IC Column in a Collection Tube. Centrifuge 	at 10,000 x g for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through.

11.	Add 200 µl ZymoBIOMICSTM DNA Wash Buffer 2 to the Zymo-SpinTM IC Column in a Collection Tube. Centrifuge 	at 10,000 x g for 1 minute.

12.	Transfer the Zymo-SpinTM IC Column to a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and add 10 µl ZymoBIOMICSTM 	DNase/RNase Free Water directly to the column matrix and incubate for 1 minute. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g 	for 1 minute. 

13.	Repeat Step 12 

14.	Place a Zymo-SpinTM II-µHRC Filter in a new Collection Tube and add 600 µl ZymoBIOMICSTM HRC Prep 	Solution. Centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 3 minutes. 

15.	Place the Zymo-SpinTM II-µHRC Filter to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Transfer all the eluted DNA 	from Step 13 to the filter. Centrifuge at exactly 16,000 x g for 3 minutes.

16.	The eluted DNA is now suitable for PCR and other downstream applications or needs to be stored at -20°C. 

NOTES: The DNA extraction was carried out with 10 samples at a time to ensure optimal workflow and to prevent the DNA from being exposed to air or buffers for too long. Also, after Step 5, there was still some remaining supernatant in the DNA/RNA ShieldTM Lysis Tube, which can be used for another DNA extraction.
